### Using a local proxy

<div data-visible="$$proxy$$">

We have deployed an Open AI proxy service for you, so you can use it to work on this workshop locally before deploying anything to Azure.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, and add the following content:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_URL=$$proxy$$
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

</div>

### Deploy to Azure

If you want to deploy your application to Azure, you will need an Azure account (more on that later).

> Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). Your account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions at a subscription level to allow deployment of Azure resources.

> If you have your own personal Azure subscription, you should be good to go. If you're using an Azure subscription provided by your company, you may need to contact your IT department to ensure you have the necessary permissions.
